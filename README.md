  - **controllers/**: Controllers for handling requests and responses.
  - **models/**: Mongoose models for defining data schemas.
  - **routes/**: Express routes for API endpoints.
  - **config/**: Configuration files, including database connection settings.
  - **middleware/**: Middleware functions for request handling.
- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for building the backend image.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration for running the backend and MongoDB in containers.
- **.env**: Environment variables for the project, including `MONGO_URI`.
- **package.json**: Node.js dependencies and scripts.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-backend.git
cd blog-backend
```
2. Install Dependencies
